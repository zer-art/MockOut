The instruction, Add #45,RI does
A. Adds the value of 45 to the address of Rl and stores 45 in that address
B. Adds 45 to the value of Ri and stores it in R1
C. Finds the memory location 45 and adds that content to that of RI
D. None of the mentioned


Add #45, when this instruction is executed the following happen/s
-
A. The processor raises an error and requests for one more operand
B. The value stored in memory location 45 is retrieved and one more operand is requested
C. The value 45 gets added to the value on the stack and is pushed onto the stack
D. None of the mentioned

#Q. In the following indexed addressing mode instruction, MOV 5(R1), LOC the 
effective address is ---
A.EA = 5+R1
B.EA = R1
C.EA = [R1]
D.EA = 5+ [R1]


When we use auto increment or auto decrements, which of the following is/are true?
(0)
In both, the address is used to retrieve the operand and then the address gets altered
(2) In auto increment, the operand is retrieved first and then the address altered
(3)
Both of them can be used on general purpose registers as well as memory locations
